# React Pong

Classic Pong game built using ES6, React.js, & HTML5 canvas.

Purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with ES6 while at the same time play around with the concept of canvas rendering using React components.

Demo: [http://rjbernaldo.github.io/react-pong](http://rjbernaldo.github.io/react-pong)

**Controls**

&uarr; - Move paddle up

&darr; - Move paddle down

**Notes**

Working but it's far from complete. Logic/implementation is mostly hacked together. Encountered several inconsistencies mostly with React's features like maintaing state, the virtual dom, etc. You've been warned. Feel free to give me feedback though as I really want to learn the best way to implement this kind of project.

Thanks!
