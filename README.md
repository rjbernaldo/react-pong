# React Pong

Classic Pong game built using ES6, React.js, & HTML5 canvas.

Purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with ES6 while at the same time play around with the concept of canvas rendering using React components.

** Controls **

[^] (Arrow up) Move paddle up

[v] (Arrow down) Move paddle down

** Notes **

Working but it's far from complete. Logic/implementation is mostly hacked together. Encountered several inconsistencies mostly with React's features like maintaing state, the virtual dom, etc. You've been warned. Feel free to give me feedback though as I really want to learn the best way to implement this kind of project.

Thanks!
